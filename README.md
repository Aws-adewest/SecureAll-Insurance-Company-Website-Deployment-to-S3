## Features

- Static website hosted on Amazon S3
- Custom domain support with Amazon Route 53
- HTTPS enabled via AWS Certificate Manager
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Fast content delivery using Amazon CloudFront

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the website, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aws-adewest/secureall-insurance-website-to-S3.git
   cd secureall-insurance-website-to-S3
   ```

2. **Build the website (if applicable):**

   If you are using a build tool (e.g., Webpack, Gulp), run the build command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Create an S3 bucket:**

   Go to the AWS S3 console and create a new bucket. Ensure the bucket name matches your desired website URL (e.g., `www.secureallinsurance.com`).

4. **Configure the bucket for static website hosting:**

   - In the bucket properties, enable static website hosting.
   - Set the index document (e.g., `index.html`).
   - Optionally set the error document (e.g., `404.html`).

5. **Upload the website files:**

   You can upload the files directly through the S3 console or use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws s3 sync ./dist s3://my-static-website-bucket-1
   ```

6. **Set bucket policy for public access:**

   Navigate to the Permissions tab and update the bucket policy to allow public access to the website files:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-bucket-1/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Configuration

You can customize the website by editing the following files:

- `index.html`: Main entry point of the website.
- `styles.css`: Styles for the website.
- `script.js`: JavaScript functionality.

## Accessing the Website

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your website at the following URL:

- S3 URL: `http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`
- Custom domain (if configured): `https://www.secureallinsurance.com`
  
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Check AWS Permissions: Ensure that your AWS user has the required permissions to access S3, CloudFront, and Route 53.
S3 Bucket Policy: Verify that your bucket policy allows public access.
CloudFront Distribution: If using CloudFront, ensure that the distribution is deployed and the status is set to “Deployed”.
Logs: Check the CloudFront and S3 logs for any errors or access issues.
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for any enhancements or bugs.

### Notes:
- Replace placeholders (e.g., `your-username`, `my-static-website-bucket-1`, `<region>`) with your actual values.
- Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured properly and the user has the necessary permissions for S3 and any other services you use.
- If you have additional configurations, features, or specific build tools, include those details as necessary.
